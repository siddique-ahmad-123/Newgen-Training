  <p class="highlight-blue" align="center" id="1">
    Algeria, officially the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria, is a country in the Maghreb region of North Africa.
    It is bordered to the northeast by Tunisia; to the east by Libya; to the southeast by Niger; to the southwest by
    Mali, Mauritania, and Western Sahara; to the west by Morocco; and to the north by the Mediterranean Sea. The capital
    and largest city is Algiers, located in the far north on the Mediterranean coast. Inhabited since prehistory,
    Algeria has been at the crossroads of numerous cultures and civilisations, including the Phoenicians, Numidians,
    Romans, Vandals, and Byzantine Greeks. Its modern identity is rooted in centuries of Arab Muslim migration waves
    since the seventh century and the subsequent Arabisation of the indigenous populations.
  </p>

  <p class="highlight-green" id="2">
    Following a succession of Islamic Arab and Berber dynasties between the eighth and 15th centuries, the Regency of
    Algiers was established in 1516 as a largely independent tributary.
  </p>

  <p class="highlight-purple" id="3">
    Algeria has a rich and diverse history that has shaped its modern identity, and it continues to be a cultural and
    political hub in North Africa.
